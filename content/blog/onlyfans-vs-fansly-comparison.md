## The Two Giants of Creator Content

OnlyFans launched in 2016 and remains the dominant platform for subscription-based creator content. Fansly launched in 2020 and has grown significantly, particularly after OnlyFans' controversial (and quickly reversed) adult content ban in 2021.

Both platforms serve similar purposes, but they differ meaningfully in features, creator tools, and subscriber experience.

## Platform Size and Creator Library

**OnlyFans** dwarfs Fansly in raw numbers. With 4+ million creators and 200+ million registered users globally, it has unmatched content variety and a more recognisable brand.

**Fansly** has grown to roughly 600,000 creators and is popular among creators who prefer its tool set or were put off by OnlyFans' inconsistent adult content policies.

**Winner: OnlyFans** for sheer catalogue size.

## Subscription Pricing

Both platforms allow creators to set any price from $0 to $49.99/month. Neither platform artificially caps what creators charge.

OnlyFans takes a **20% cut** of creator earnings. Fansly takes **20%** as well — identical for subscribers, but Fansly offers slightly different payout structures.

**Winner: Tie**

## Discovery and Search

This is where **Fansly pulls ahead**. Fansly's built-in search and discovery tools are notably better for finding new creators within the platform itself. OnlyFans has historically had weak native search, which is why third-party directories like FansPedia exist.

**Winner: Fansly** for discovery within the platform.

## Content Features

**OnlyFans:**
- Posts, stories, and live streams
- Pay-per-view messages
- Tips
- Subscription bundles

**Fansly:**
- Posts, stories, and live streams
- Tiered subscriptions (multiple subscription levels at different prices)
- Pay-per-view messages
- Tips
- More granular privacy controls

Fansly's **tiered subscriptions** are a standout — creators can offer a basic tier at $5/month and a premium tier at $20/month, letting subscribers choose their level of access. OnlyFans requires a single subscription price.

**Winner: Fansly** for creator tools.

## For Subscribers: Which Is Better?

For most subscribers, **OnlyFans** is the practical choice:

- More creators to choose from
- More recognisable — easier to know if a creator is on the platform
- Third-party tools like FansPedia help with discovery

But if you prefer a platform with better in-app discovery and tiered access options from your favourite creators, Fansly is worth exploring.

## Conclusion

OnlyFans wins on catalogue size and brand recognition. Fansly wins on creator tools and in-platform discovery. For subscribers, starting with OnlyFans and using FansPedia to find creators is the most efficient approach — then check if those creators also have a Fansly presence for additional content.
