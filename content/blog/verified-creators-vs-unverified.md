## What Is OnlyFans Verification?

OnlyFans requires all creators to submit government-issued ID before they can earn money on the platform. Once approved, they receive a verified badge — the blue checkmark you see on creator profiles.

This process confirms two things:

1. The creator is a real person aged 18 or over
2. Their identity matches the ID they submitted

## Why It Matters for Subscribers

**You know who you're subscribing to.** With unverified accounts, there's no guarantee the person in the photos or videos is who they claim to be. Verified creators have proven their identity to OnlyFans directly.

**More accountability.** Verified creators have more to lose if they violate platform rules. Their real identity is on file, which means scammy behaviour is less common among verified accounts.

**Platform trust.** OnlyFans takes verification seriously — accounts found to be fraudulent after verification face permanent bans.

## Does Verified Mean Better Content?

Not necessarily. Verification is about identity, not content quality. Plenty of unverified creators produce excellent content, and some verified creators post infrequently.

However, as a general rule, verified creators tend to be more professional and established. They're investing in a long-term presence on the platform.

## How to Filter for Verified Creators on FansPedia

On FansPedia's search page, toggle the **Verified** filter to show only verified creators. You can combine this with category, price, and location filters.

## What About "Agency" Accounts?

Some OnlyFans accounts are managed by agencies — meaning multiple people manage one account or the person chatting with you isn't the creator. These accounts can still be verified (the original creator's ID is on file), but interaction may be less personal.

Look for solo creators who reply to comments and post consistently — this signals genuine individual creation.

## Conclusion

Verified creators offer a baseline level of trust and accountability that unverified accounts don't. Use FansPedia's verified filter as a starting point, then evaluate content quality, post frequency, and price to find creators you'll genuinely enjoy.
