## How OnlyFans Pricing Works

Creators on OnlyFans set their own subscription price, anywhere from $0 (free) up to $49.99/month. The average subscription sits around $7–$12/month for most creators, with significant variation by niche and creator tier.

## Price Breakdown by Category

Data from FansPedia's 10,000+ creator database shows clear pricing patterns across niches:

**Free ($0/month)**
Many creators — particularly newer ones and those building an audience — set a free subscription and rely on pay-per-view messages and tips for revenue. Free accounts make up roughly 25% of FansPedia's database.

**Budget ($3–$7/month)**
The most common price tier. You'll find tens of thousands of creators in this range across all categories. Great value for casual subscribers.

**Mid-tier ($8–$15/month)**
Established creators with consistent posting schedules and higher production quality typically land here. Fitness creators, cosplayers, and lifestyle creators cluster in this range.

**Premium ($16–$30/month)**
High-follower verified creators with professional setups. Often includes more interactive features like direct messaging and custom content requests.

**Ultra-premium ($30+/month)**
Celebrity-adjacent creators and those with massive followings. Often justifies the price with extra perks and exclusivity.

## Bundle Discounts

Roughly 40% of creators on FansPedia offer subscription bundles — discounts for subscribing 3 or 6 months at once. A typical bundle saves 20–30% compared to paying monthly. Use FansPedia's **Bundles** filter to find creators offering deals.

## Are Expensive Subscriptions Worth It?

Price alone doesn't indicate quality. Some of the most prolific creators charge $5/month; some $30/month creators post rarely. Use FansPedia's profile cards to check:

- **Post count** — how much content has the creator published?
- **Subscriber count** — how many people find this creator worth subscribing to?
- **Verified status** — extra assurance of authenticity

## Conclusion

The sweet spot for most subscribers is the $5–$15 range with a verified badge and high post count. Use FansPedia's max price filter to stay within budget and the bundles filter to get the most value from longer commitments.
