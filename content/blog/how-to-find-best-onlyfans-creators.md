## Introduction

With millions of OnlyFans creators active in 2026, finding the right ones to follow can feel overwhelming. Whether you're into fitness, cosplay, or lifestyle content, this guide walks you through the most effective strategies.

## Use Category Filters

The fastest way to narrow your search is by category. FansPedia organises creators into dozens of niche categories — from cosplay and gaming to wellness and alt/goth. Start by browsing the categories that match your interests rather than searching blindly.

**Pro tip:** Use the compound categories like "Free OnlyFans" to find creators who offer free subscriptions, so you can check out their content before committing.

## Check the Verified Badge

Verified creators on OnlyFans have confirmed their identity with the platform. This gives you two advantages:

- **Authenticity** — the person you see is the actual creator
- **Reliability** — verified accounts are less likely to disappear overnight

On FansPedia, you can filter specifically for verified creators using the **Verified** toggle in the search bar.

## Look at the Subscription Price

Creator subscription prices range from free up to $50/month or more. FansPedia's price filter lets you set a maximum budget so you only see creators within your range.

A good strategy is to start with free or low-cost creators in a category you're curious about, then upgrade to premium creators once you know what style you enjoy.

## Read the About Section

The "About" blurb on each creator's FansPedia profile card gives a quick idea of their content style and personality. Creators who write detailed, thoughtful bios tend to be more active and engaged with their audience.

## Check Bundle Deals

Many creators offer discounted bundle subscriptions — for example, 3 months for the price of 2. FansPedia shows bundle info directly on creator cards. If you're planning to subscribe long-term, bundles can save you significantly.

## Conclusion

The best strategy combines category browsing, the verified filter, and a price range you're comfortable with. Start broad, find a few creators you enjoy, then use FansPedia's similar-creators feature to discover more like them.
