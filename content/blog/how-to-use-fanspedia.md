## What Is FansPedia?

FansPedia is a free directory of 10,000+ OnlyFans creators, updated daily. Instead of scrolling endlessly through OnlyFans itself, FansPedia lets you search, filter, and browse creators by category, location, price, and verification status — all without an OnlyFans account.

## The Search Bar

The main search bar on the homepage searches across creator names, usernames, and bios simultaneously. Type a name, keyword, or niche (e.g. "goth", "fitness", "cosplay") and results update in real-time.

**Multi-term search:** You can search for multiple keywords at once using `|` as a separator. For example: `goth|alt|dark` returns creators matching any of those terms.

## Filters

Below the search bar are four main filters:

- **Verified** — show only identity-verified creators
- **Free** — show only creators with a $0 subscription price
- **Bundles** — show only creators offering subscription bundle discounts
- **Max Price** — set a maximum monthly subscription price

Filters stack — you can combine "Verified + Free" or "Bundles + Max $10" to narrow results precisely.

## Category Pages

Click **Categories** in the header to browse all creator niches. Each category page shows creators tagged in that niche, with the same search and filter tools available.

Popular categories include:

- Cosplay
- Fitness & Wellness
- Gaming
- Alt / Goth
- Latina
- MILF

## Location Pages

The **Locations** section lets you browse creators by country. Currently available locations include:

- United States
- Canada
- India
- Japan

The **Near Me** feature uses your browser's location to surface creators who have listed a nearby city in their bio.

## The Wishlist

The wishlist feature (heart icon, bottom nav) lets you save creators you want to revisit. Wishlisted creators are stored in your browser — no account needed.

Add a creator to your wishlist by clicking the heart icon on their card. Access your full wishlist anytime from the bottom navigation.

## Infinite Scroll and Load More

FansPedia loads results in pages of 20. When you reach the bottom, click **Load More** to continue browsing. This keeps the page fast even with thousands of results.

## Conclusion

FansPedia is designed to make creator discovery fast and easy. Start with a keyword search, apply a filter or two, and explore category pages to find exactly the type of content you're looking for.
