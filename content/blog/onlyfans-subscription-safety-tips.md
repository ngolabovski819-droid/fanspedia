## Your Privacy Matters

Subscribing to OnlyFans is safe when done correctly. The platform uses HTTPS, processes payments securely, and doesn't share your identity with creators. That said, there are smart habits worth building to protect yourself further.

## Use a Dedicated Email Address

Consider creating a secondary email address specifically for OnlyFans. This keeps your main inbox clean and adds a layer of separation between your OnlyFans activity and your everyday life.

## Use a Virtual Card for Payment

Services like Privacy.com (US) or Revolut (UK/EU) let you create virtual debit cards with custom spending limits. This means:

- **Spend control** — set a monthly limit so you can't accidentally overspend
- **Easy cancellation** — pause the virtual card to stop recurring charges instantly
- **Privacy** — your real card number is never exposed

## Check the Creator's Profile Before Subscribing

On FansPedia, you can see a creator's subscriber count, post count, and whether they're verified before you subscribe. Creators with high post counts and a verified badge are more established and trustworthy.

## Be Cautious with Personal Information

Never share your full name, home address, or contact details with creators through DMs. Legitimate creators don't need this information.

## Watch Out for Scam Accounts

Red flags include:
- Very new accounts with zero posts
- Promises of explicit content that seems too good to be true
- Requests to move conversation off-platform immediately

## Understand the Refund Policy

OnlyFans subscriptions are generally non-refundable. Use the free-trial period (if a creator offers one) or browse their public posts on FansPedia before committing.

## Conclusion

A few simple precautions — a separate email, a virtual card, and checking a creator's profile first — make subscribing to OnlyFans safe and stress-free. FansPedia's verified filter helps you find trusted creators quickly.
